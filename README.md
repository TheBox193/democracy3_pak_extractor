# Democracy 3 Pak Extractor
Extracts .pak mod files into their individual files so that you can reassemble them manually! Sorry.

## CLI Usage

```bash
node extractorCLI.js <inputName>.pak
```

- Extracts to: `./output/<inputName>/`
- Mirrors folder structure inside the pak

**Example:**

```bash
node extractorCLI.js mods/centralbank.pak
```

# License
Do whatever the heck you want. I just like making things.
